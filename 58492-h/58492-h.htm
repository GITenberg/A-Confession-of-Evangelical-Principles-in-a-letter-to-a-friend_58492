3</span>Letter.</h2>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Banbury</i>; <i>February</i> 1st,
1808.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> you have solicited me to
vindicate myself from the things laid to my charge, I take this
opportunity of making public the sentiments I hold; and I will
answer the rest of the charges at the close of my confession of
faith.&nbsp; The charges brought against me, are these four;
<i>First</i>, That I hold and propogate Antinomian
sentiments.&nbsp; <i>Secondly</i>, That I create divisions
wherever I preach.&nbsp; <i>Thirdly</i>, That after People come
to hear me preach, they cannot with pleasure hear their own
Ministers again.&nbsp; And, <i>Fourthly</i>, That I do not preach
to Sinners.&nbsp; These are heavy charges indeed!&nbsp; With
respect to the <i>first</i>, as my sentiments are deemed
Antinomian, I think it my duty to make them public: the rest of
the charges are not worth an answer.&nbsp; But, I can assure you,
Sir, that the leading doctrines I preach, are in harmony with the
Word of God, which is the only rule of faith and practice: I
embrace and propogate no other doctrines than these, set forth in
the doctrinal Articles of the Church of England; the Westminster
Confession of Faith; and what your own Ministers, who belong to
the Associations, generally hold, as appears upon their circular
letters; namely, receiving the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament, as their only guide in faith and practice; and thence
deriving their belief, in the important doctrines of three equal
Persons, in one divine essence; Eternal and personal Election;
Original Sin; Justification, by the imputed righteousness <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of Christ;
Efficacious Grace in Regeneration; the final perseverance of
Believers to eternal Glory; the resurrection of the Dead; the
last Judgment; the everlasting happiness of the Righteous; and
the punishment of the Impenitent.&nbsp; These, Sir, are the
leading doctrines I preach, and they stand in no need of an
apology: but, as I am set for the defence of that gospel I have
felt and enjoyed, I am not ashamed of one of its glorious
doctrines; nor did I ever intentionally deviate from them in one
sentence I ever pronounced, since I have felt their power, seen
their beauty, and have been enabled to declare them; and that
good hand that instructed me in them, and has owned and blest
them, by me, as an instrument, I trust, will enable me to
maintain them to the close of life; then, I hope to feel them
supporting my soul, comforting my heart, and giving me a sweet
assurance of an entrance into that kingdom, that cannot be
moved.</p>
<p>The following doctrines I have been enabled to declare amidst
great opposition, and, as they are a part of the revealed will of
God, those who oppose them, are fighting against God
himself.&nbsp; As to the loss of the favor and friendship of
those Ministers who are strangers to the power of Godliness, and
averse to the humiliating doctrines of the Cross of Christ, this,
I hope, will not break my heart; and while they are loading me
with reproach, I shall not render railing for railing; for while
they curse, I will bless; while they condemn, I hope God will
justify; while they oppose, I know he will lead on; and, I hope,
I shall be enabled to put up that charitable prayer for my
enemies, which the Redeemer did for his; &ldquo;Father, forgive
them:&rdquo; <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>in the language of dying Stephen, &ldquo;Lord, lay not
this to their charge:&rdquo; and in the pious breathings of the
Church of England Litany, I would pray, &ldquo;That it may please
thee, to forgive our enemies, persecutors, and slanderers, and to
turn their hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while many in our day are shy
of the doctrines of the gospel, (which is an awful proof they
never felt their power, and never tasted their sweetness, so that
they are but little consequence to them;) I hope, I shall be
enabled to stand fast in the faith, and hold the beginning of my
confidence firm, unto the end; not at all terrified by any of my
adversaries, however popular they may be.&nbsp; If I could
palliate and comply with their dead barren dry system of
legality, I believe that they would cease to reproach me.&nbsp;
But, because I maintain and declare the whole counsel of God, I
am deemed an Antinomian; a Troubler of Churches; a Sower of
Dissentions; a Creator of Divisions; One that Disaffects Hearers
with their own Ministers; One that does not preach to Sinners;
and, in fact, every thing that is disrespectful in the estimation
of proud Legalists, and self-righteous Pharisees.</p>
<p>The following Confession, I read at my Ordination, with a few
additions; and as many of my friends have so repeatedly intreated
me to make it public, I take this opportunity of doing it,
praying that the best of blessings may accompany the same, as
they are sentiments calculated to display the glory of God, and
bring joy and peace to that Sinner who is made sensible of his
lost condition.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>A
Confession of Faith.</h2>
<p>I.&nbsp; I believe, that the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament are the word of God, and the only rule of faith and
practice.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I believe, that there is but One only, living, and
true God; that there are Three Persons in the Godhead, who are
equal in nature, power, and glory; and, that the Son and Holy
Ghost, are as truly and properly God, as the Father.&nbsp; These
Three divine Persons are distinguished from each other by
peculiar relative properties.&nbsp; These Three divine distinct
Persons, I profess to reverence, serve, and worship, as the One
true God.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; I believe, that before the World began, God did
elect a certain number of Mankind unto everlasting life, whom he
did predestinate to the adoption of Children, by Jesus Christ, of
his own free grace, and according to the good pleasure of his
will; that he appointed holiness as the means; and that no one
has a right to consider himself as a chosen vessel, till he is
effectually called by the grace of God. <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>IV.&nbsp;
I believe, that God made all things in Creation, out of nothing,
to display his goodness, wisdom, power, and glory; and, that by
the same power, he upholds and governs, rules and directs all
things in Heaven and Earth; and, that he displays his sovereignty
according to the counsel of his own will, or his eternal plan,
formed before all Worlds.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; I believe, that there is one Mediator between God and
Man; the Man, Christ Jesus; that he stood in his mediatorial
capacity as our representative and head, in the covenant of
eternal redemption and grace; engaged to be all that to his
people, they could possibly need in time, and their bliss through
eternity.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>VI.&nbsp;
I believe, that God made Man upright; but mutable and liable to
fall: and, being left to the freedom of his own will, through the
influence of Satan, he broke the covenant of works, and fell from
the Image of God; that all Mankind sinned in him and fell with
him, as their head and representative; and both him and his
posterity became liable to the curse and penalty of a violated
law.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; I believe, that all Mankind are conceived and born
in sin, Children of disobedience, enemies to God, violaters of
his commands, averse to good, prone to evil, Children of wrath,
obnoxious to the justice of God, and the condemnation of his law:
and I believe, that no Creature can help or deliver himself, out
of that wretched state into which he has fallen.&nbsp; I solemnly
believe, that this is the state of all Men by nature.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; I believe, that according to the eternal
appointment of God the Father, and the Covenant engagements of
the dear Redeemer, that, in the fulness of time, God sent his Son
into the world to redeem fallen Men; that part of the human race,
that was given him in eternity; that their redemption was
obtained by the shedding of his blood; that this redemption is
special and particular, designed only for the elect of God, the
Sheep of Christ, who only share the special and peculiar
blessings of it.&nbsp; And, in order to accomplish our
redemption, I believe, it was necessary that the Redeemer should
take upon him our nature, a human body and soul, created and
formed by God the Spirit, conceived in the womb of the Virgin
Mary, born of a Woman, made under the law, that he might redeem
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>his people
from it; work out a righteousness adequate to its demands, make
an atonement by suffering the death of the Cross, satisfy divine
Justice, glorify all the attributes of Deity, and open a way, for
the communication of all those blessings, which are needful for
the Saints of God, both for time and eternity.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; I believe, that the matter of the Sinners&rsquo;
justification before a holy God, is the righteousness of Christ
imputed to them; which is, his perfect, spotless obedience to the
law, in their room and stead, without the consideration of any
works done by them; and, that the full and free pardon of all
their sins, past, present, and to come, is only through the blood
of Christ, according to the riches of his grace; and, that none
can be justified in any other way.&nbsp; This righteousness being
seen by the eye of faith, and embraced by the hand of faith, we
are manifestly justified and freed from the law; that, being dead
wherein we were held, we live to God, and by love serve the Lord,
having our fruit unto holiness, and the end, eternal life. <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>X.&nbsp; I believe, that all the objects of eternal
love, the subjects of his choice, and the purchase of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s blood, are effectually called in one way or
another, by the efficacious and irresistible grace of God the
divine Spirit; and not by an act of Man&rsquo;s free will and
power.&nbsp; I believe they are washed, justified, and
sanctified, in the name and by God the Spirit, in some part of
their lives.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; I believe, that all Saints are kept by the mighty
power of God, through faith, to eternal Salvation; and, that as
sure as they are called, justified, and sanctified, they will
infallibly persevere: because of the perpetuity of God&rsquo;s
love, the liability of his covenant, and his faithfulness to his
absolute promises.</p>
<p>XII.&nbsp; I believe, that the Church of Christ consists of
true believers in his name; that these are his mystical body, of
which, he is the only head, and there is no other: and, that all
the Children of God derive spiritual life from him, by virtue of
union to him; that he is our life; and in consequence of that, we
are now quickened by his life-giving power in conversion; our
bodies shall be quickened in the last day, and all Believers
shall enjoy eternal life, in glory for ever.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>XIII.&nbsp; I believe, that in the new testament Church
of Christ, there are but two Sacraments; Baptism, and the Supper
of the Lord.&nbsp; I believe, Baptism to be an outward and
visible sign; first, of the sufferings, death, burial, and
resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ; secondly, of an inward and
spiritual operation of the Holy Ghost, upon the hearts of
believers; and is a grand emblem of a death unto sin, and a new
birth unto righteousness; for being by nature the children of
wrath, we are by regeneration, manifested to be children of
grace.&nbsp; I believe, that only those who profess the name of
Jesus, have any right thereto.&nbsp; That it should be
administered to Adults alone, in the name of the adorable
Trinity; and, that it is to be performed by immersion.&nbsp; I
believe, that the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was instituted the night on
which he was betrayed, to represent his sufferings and death; and
is to be attended too by all Believers, until his second
coming.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; I believe, that it is the duty of every Christian
to obey the laws of their Country; not to speak evil of
Dignities; but, to pray for the King, his Family, and the
Government under which we live; to study to be quiet, peaceable,
and submissive, according to the laws of Jesus Christ, which is
our rule of conduct: and, who has said, &ldquo;Render unto
C&aelig;sar, the things which are his;&rdquo; and, by his holy
Apostles, has commanded &ldquo;That every Soul should be subject
to the higher powers; that we should honor all Men, love the
Brotherhood, fear God, honor the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>XV.&nbsp; I believe, that it is the duty of all
Believers, to take the commands of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ, as their rule of conduct; that, while they are relying on
his Righteousness, for justification; on his Blood, for pardon;
and, on the Spirit, for internal sanctification; they, from a
principle of love shed abroad in their hearts, are made willing
to obey his laws, as King in Mount Zion: and, that his
commandments are the Believer&rsquo;s rule of life: that it is
their duty to stand fast in one Spirit, with one mind, striving
together for the faith of the gospel: that it is their duty to
walk in wisdom, to them that are without; to exercise a
conscience void of offence towards God and Man, by living
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world: that it is
their duty to walk with each other in all humility and brotherly
love; to watch over each other&rsquo;s conversation; to stir up
one another to love and to good works; not forsaking the
assembling of ourselves together, as we have opportunity; to
worship God, according to his revealed will; and, when the case
requires, to warn, rebuke, and admonish one another, according to
the rules of the gospel: and, that it is our duty to sympathize
with each other, to bear with one another&rsquo;s weaknesses,
failings, and infirmities; and, particularly to pray for one
another.&nbsp; All these duties we are bound to perform, and
every other law of Christ&rsquo;s spiritual house, through the
gracious influence of a Spirit of love, of power, and of a sound
mind; ever remembering, that we are to obey the laws of our
Sovereign, as King, on his holy hill of Zion. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>XVI.&nbsp; I believe, that all the Ordinances of divine
appointment ought to be attended unto, by all that profess their
faith in, and love to our Lord Jesus Christ, as the head of his
Church; hearing the Word, public Prayer, Baptism, and the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper: singing of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual
Songs, vocally; this is an ordinance of the gospel, to be
performed by Believers; but, as to time, place, and manner, every
one ought to be left to their liberty in using it.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>XVII.&nbsp; I believe, that there will be a
Resurrection, both of the just and unjust; and, that Christ will
come a second time, to judge both quick and dead; when he will
take vengeance on the wicked, and introduce his own People into
his kingdom and glory, where they shall be for ever with him;
and, then shall the mediatorial kingdom be delivered up to the
Father, by the Redeemer; the mystery of God be finished: Heaven
will be the Saints final home; and, God, Father, Son, and Spirit,
be all in all, for ever and ever.</p>
<p>XVIII.&nbsp; I believe, that the felicity of the Saints will
be eternal; and I as firmly believe, such will be the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>eternity of
misery; unless, the never dying worm dies, and the unquenchable
fire goes out; which will not, cannot be; for the mouth of the
Lord hath spoken it.</p>

<div class="gapshortdoubleline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above Articles are the doctrines I preach, which I did not
learn of Man; but, by the teachings of the Spirit, by the
Word.&nbsp; The rest of the Charges are not worthy my notice, as
they arise from pride and envy; and, I shall only remark, that
all faithful preaching ever did create divisions.&nbsp; God
having put an enmity between the seed of the Woman, and the seed
of the Serpent; this enmity is stirred up wherever these two
seeds meet.&nbsp; The history of Truth, in all ages, prove that
this is no new thing.&nbsp; The dear Redeemer, asks an important
question, &ldquo;Suppose ye, that I am come to give peace on the
earth?&nbsp; I tell you, nay; but rather divisions;&rdquo; see
the 12th chapter of Luke, from the 40th to the 54th verse.&nbsp;
As to the disaffection of the People to their own Ministers,
after hearing me preach, as Ministers inform you; how can I help
that?&nbsp; I do not speak against them; but, advise my hearers
to follow after truth, in its beauty, simplicity, and
power.&nbsp; But I am not accountable for the imprudencies of my
hearers.&nbsp; None ever heard me in public or in private, drop a
disrespectful hint of any Ministers around me; although, I am
informed, they have said many cruel things of me: for which, I
trust, the good Lord will pardon them, for I do; as I know, God,
for Christ&rsquo;s sake, hath forgiven me.&nbsp; As to the last
Charge you intimate, that I do not preach to Sinners.&nbsp; This
is an absurd accusation indeed!&nbsp; For who do I, or who can I
preach to, but fallen Sinners, by nature and practice; as faith
the voice of wisdom, &ldquo;Unto you, O Men, I call, and my voice
is to the Sons of Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, I suppose the meaning of
this Charge is, that I do not command dead Sinners to quicken
their own souls; and suppose <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>I did, would they obey me?&nbsp; That
I do not tell blind Sinners to open their own eyes?&nbsp; If I
thought they could do it, I would tell them to do it, from the
pulpit.&nbsp; That I do not tell all Men it is their duty to
believe?&nbsp; Whereas, God says of many, they never shall
believe.&nbsp; That I do not command carnal Persons to perform
spiritual acts? and how should they? seeing they are enemies to
God, and the slaves of sin and error.&nbsp; That I do not tell
all Mankind, that Christ is offered to them, if they will but
accept of him?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Sir.&nbsp; I leave all this
Baxterian stubble, and declare the whole counsel of God.&nbsp;
Whereas, the above Calls to Sinners, form no part of that
counsel.&nbsp; God does not condemn Men because he has been
pleased to withold that precious gift of faith from them: there
is sin enough in all Men, to render them obnoxious to the curse
of the law: and the Saviour himself says, &ldquo;Think not, that
I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuseth you
already, even, Moses, in whom ye trust.&rdquo;&nbsp; To command
all Men, where the gospel comes, to obey the internal call of it,
is not my work: but, to tell People, it is their duty to be found
in the means, is another thing.&nbsp; The former, I shall not do;
the latter, is in harmony with many parts of God&rsquo;s
Word.&nbsp; But I know it is fashionable, to tell Sinners to
believe, and to receive an offered Christ; to open the door of
their hearts to him; and, in fact, the Sinner is set to do that,
which the Holy Ghost only can do for him.&nbsp; This is the
modern doctrine so much admired in our day; which is calculated
to cherish the pride of Man, and make Sinners contented with a
form of godliness without the power.&nbsp; But, &ldquo;From all
false doctrine, heresy, and schism, good Lord deliver
us.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Footnotes.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote6"></a><a href="#citation6"
class="footnote">[6]</a>&nbsp; This doctrine is clearly revealed
in the Scriptures, embraced by our Reformers, as set forth in the
17th Article of the Church of England, and in the Westminster
Confession of Faith.&nbsp; The Seventeenth Article of the Church,
thus expresseth this doctrine:&mdash;&ldquo;Predestination to
Life, is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the
foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by
his counsel, secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation
those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring
them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to
honour.&nbsp; Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a
benefit of God, be called according to God&rsquo;s purpose by his
Spirit working in due season; they through grace obey the
calling; they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by
adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son,
Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length,
by God&rsquo;s mercy, they attain to everlasting
felicity.&rdquo;&mdash;This is the noble testimony of our
Reformers, as agreed and subscribed to by every conscientious
Churchman; to this agree, the Westminster Confession of Faith, as
exprest in the 20th Article of the shorter Catechism.&nbsp; God
having out of his mere good pleasure, from all eternity, elected
some to everlasting life, did enter into a Covenant of grace, to
deliver them out of the estate of sin and misery, and to bring
them into an estate of salvation by a Redeemer.&nbsp; A vast many
passages of scripture can easily be brought to prove this
important Article; and, happy for those, who have got the sweet
evidence of God&rsquo;s Spirit, witnessing their adoption into
his family.&nbsp; If this is Antinomianism, I am willing to bear
the name, and enjoy the blessings of an everlasting Covenant of
Election and Sovereign Grace.</p>
<p><a name="footnote9"></a><a href="#citation9"
class="footnote">[9]</a>&nbsp; This doctrine of a Sinner&rsquo;s
justification before God, as exprest in this Article, is held
forth in almost every part of God&rsquo;s Word that relates to
our Salvation.&nbsp; This doctrine, however despised in our day
by modern Pharisees, is a glorious and a precious truth: it was
received by our Reformers, as noted in the Eleventh Article of
the Church of England, on the justification of Man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for our
own works or deservings: Wherefore, that we are justified by
faith only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of
comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of
justification.&rdquo;&nbsp; See also, the Thirty-third Article in
the Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism: &ldquo;Justification is an act of
God&rsquo;s free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our sins, and
accepteth us as righteous in his sight, only for the
righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by faith
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy Believer, that can say in sweet
assurance,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jesus, thy blood and righteousness,<br />
My beauty are, my glorious dress;<br />
&rsquo;Midst flaming Worlds, in these array&rsquo;d,<br />
With joy shall I lift up my head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this honor have all the Saints.</p>
<p><a name="footnote12"></a><a href="#citation12"
class="footnote">[12]</a>&nbsp; If it can be proved, that this
Article has a grain of Antinomianism in it, I ask, are not these
the practical truths of the gospel, which we, as Believers, are
to obey, as a proof we are passed from death unto life, and are
brought to serve the Lord, in newness of Spirit, and not in the
oldness of the letter; not working for life, but from a principle
of life received, as being not without law to God, but under the
laws of our present Husband, Christ.&nbsp; The moral law being
fulfilled in our stead, we are by faith enabled to serve him, who
has done so great things for us.&nbsp; It is the Believer&rsquo;s
desire, that the moral law should be fulfilled; and, to use the
language of a good and great Man, it is evident this law is
fulfilled in a fourfold sense; First, &ldquo;In precept and
penalty, by the Redeemer himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Secondly,
&ldquo;In the Believed, when the love of God is shed abroad in
his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thirdly, &ldquo;In the exercise of a
conscience void of offence, by the internal operations of the
Spirit, enabling us to walk in our degree, as he
walked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fourthly, &ldquo;In the execution of its
awful sentence upon the wicked; and Heaven and Earth shall pass
away, before a tittle of this law can fail, till it be
fulfilled.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is strange, that those Ministers, who
maintain the holiness, goodness, truth, and justice of the moral
law, should be traduced as Antinomians; whereas, they are the
only characters that handle the law, lawfully; by representing it
to Believers as fulfilled in their stead, by their covenant Head
and Husband; laying them under eternal obligations to love and
serve him in newness of the Spirit.&nbsp; The term Antinomian,
cannot belong to the above characters, but to all Men in a state
of nature, whether professors or prophane, they are in a state of
enmity against the law, and its adorable giver; and, although
they may plead for it, they are enemies to it, ignorant of it,
and condemned by it.&nbsp; It is evident, this was the case of
Paul, before his conversion, &ldquo;I was alive without the law
once;&rdquo; he was ignorant of its nature, its author, its
demands, and its curse: but, when God led him to see himself in
that glass, he exclaimed, &ldquo;The law is spiritual, but I am
carnal, sold under sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; When David was taught the
same lesson, he crys out, &ldquo;I have seen an end of all
perfection, but thy commandments are exceeding
broad.&rdquo;&nbsp; All that are cleaving to this law, as a
covenant of works, are enemies to the Lord Jesus Christ; and, all
that die under it, must be judged by it.&nbsp; Now, because I
hold forth the grand doctrines of the gospel, and enforce a
knowledge of this law, by the teachings of the Spirit of God,
that Sinners may be brought to see their need of a Mediator, and
a Surety righteousness; for this, I am condemned as an
Antinomian!&nbsp; But, if this Article of my Confession, teaches
anything like it, I must say it is the Antinomianism of the
gospel, which I shall consider as my duty to enforce, as
ornamental to the Religion of the Son of God.&nbsp; I shall only
add, that I was much pleased to see this subject ably handled, in
that best of monthly publications, the Gospel Magazine: one
paragraph I shall insert, see vol. 9, page 372.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
doctrine of the total abolition of the covenant of works, and the
perfect deliverance of all true Believers from its power and
authority, by the substitution, obedience, and atonement of
Christ, breaks the arms of ungodliness, demolishes the whole
empire of sin, and makes the church of the first born fruitful to
God.&nbsp; Fruitful in heart, fruitful in life, fruitful in every
good work.&nbsp; The proof which the Scriptures afford of the
truth of these assertions, mocks all contradiction, and bids
defiance to all assault.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
